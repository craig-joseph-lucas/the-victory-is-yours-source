We need to be separate from the world but not isolated from the world. We should not walk in the counsel of the wicked.

Who are the wicked? They are the unbelievers. They are the atheists. They are people who don't seek God. They are sinners who rebel against God.

Remember we all are sinners and we all for short of the glory of God. We need God's help to not sin. The Holy Spirit works to convict us of sin day by day through the process of sanctification. 

Sin usually starts small. Usually starts with us walking in Sin. Then next we know we are standing in it. The last thing we want is to be sitting in sin.

Sin leads to sadness. Holiness leads to happiness. This is why we should besaturated in God's word. 

### Here is what should do daily

- Read the Bible 
- Delight in the Word or God. 
- Meditate day and night on the Bible. 
- We should obey the word of God - James 1:22-25

What does mediation mean? Means to empty your mind. The jewish in Israel they mutter the words non stop.


### What are the benefits of being a man of God

We become like a tree. We have a purpose. We were planted by God. We will bear fruit through any season in life. We should prosper in all we do. 

### The Ungodly 
- They are driven away by the wind and headed for destruction.

### The Godly 
- They are like a tree. They will prosper in all they do.
