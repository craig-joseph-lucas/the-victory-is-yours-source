We need to be separate from the world but not isolated from the world. We should not walk in the counsel of the wicked.

Who are the wicked? They are the unbelievers. They are atheists. They don't seek God. They are sinners who rebel against God.

Sin starts small. We start walking. Then we are standing and then sitting in sin.

Sin leads to sadness. Holiness leads to happiness. We should be saturated in God's word. 


- Read the Bible 
- Delight in the Word
- Meditate day and night on the Bible. 
- We should obey the word of God > James 1:22-25

What does mediation mean? Means to empty your mind. The Jews would mutter the words non stop. 


## What are the benefits of being a man of God

We become like a tree. It applies purpose. We were planted by God. We will bear fruit through the seasons. We should prosper in all we do. 

## The Ungodly 
- They are driven away by the wind and headed for destruction.

## The Godly 
- They are like a tree. They will prosper in all they do. 



Read psalm 1 and try to remember it. 

Job 23
Psalm 119:23
