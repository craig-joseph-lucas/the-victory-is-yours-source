Being happy is all about perspective. Yes you can choose happiness. Happiness is a choice.

What is one of the biggest reasons of being happy? It's when we focus on what we don't have. Instead of being grateful for the things you do have. Remember everything good in your life comes from God. It's up to God how and when he blesses us. So once you change your perspective you will see how blessed you really are. 

Finally remember it's always best to be humble. God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.
