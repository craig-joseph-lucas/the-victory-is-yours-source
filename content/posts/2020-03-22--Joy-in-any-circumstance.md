Sometimes it may be hard to remain joyous under intense situations like what we are going through with the Corona Virus. However, it's important to remember that God is in control. The passage here in Philippians 1 give us the blueprint on how to remain joyous

Three things that Paul was thankful
  - Fellowship in the Gospel - despite what is going on we have fellowship with other

What did Paul pray for
1) He prayed that the believers would have an abounding love. 
2) He prayed that the believers would have discernment. 
3) He prayed that his fellow believers would have a genuine and blameless character
4) He prayed that his fellow believers would bear fruit

When Christ is preached that is what brought Joy to Paul.
Paul was arrested and thrown on a ship. 
Paul was convinced everything that happened to him was part of Gods will so he was able to remain joyous. As long as others can see Christ in you. You are bearing fruit. To bear fruit furthers the kingdom and this will bring you joy. 


strengthen the believers fellowship in the Gospel
to help further the Gospel
he gave the church the opportunity to stand for the faith of the gospel. 

Christ being exalted
Christ being magnified in

We have joy because 
we have opportunity to defend the gospel - v27-30

We can have the joy of the Lord
