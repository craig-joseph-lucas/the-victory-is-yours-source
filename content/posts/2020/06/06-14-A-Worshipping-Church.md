Church gathers to worship

The main priority of the church is to worship God.

We should sing and give as an act of worship
Everything we should do is an act of worship.

Worship is the only activity we will take with us to Heaven
We will 

Revelation 4 and 5

Worship - comes from worth and ship? Look this up

5 marks of a worshipping church

1) **Has a balanced worship** - should be formal and informal . Psalm 91:1. Worhip should be joyful 
2) **Our worship should be biblical** - What does the bible say about it. Worship should be based on God's revelation to us in the bible. Don't make up your own God. Otherwise you are worshipping yourself. You can't worship God without knowing the bible. We worship in spirit and truth. Worship is to be with all your mind, your body and will. 
3) **Worship should be congregational** - not saying you can't worship God wherever you are. There is power in congregational worship.  Psalam 149:1, Hebrews 10:25,Ephesians 5:18-20
4) **Worship should be spiritual** - Jacob's well. You should be spirit led when you worship. We want the full foucs on Jesus. The spirit energizes and directs our worship. Isiah 29:11
5) **Worship should be transformative** - Worship flows from a surrendered heart. God wants your heart. What good is your worship if it doesn't transform your life. We must sacrifice everything to Jesus.
