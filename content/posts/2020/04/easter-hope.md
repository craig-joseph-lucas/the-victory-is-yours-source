Jesus was crucified on Friday and was buried.
It was a somber saturday. People were devastated they thought their savior was truly dead. 

The stone was rolled away! The tomb was empty!
The stone was rolled away not for Jesus but so the disciples could come in. 

Their was two angels one at the foot and one at the head.

What was the angels message. 

Fear not in verse 6

We don't need to fear because Jesus is alive. 
He was not there. He was not in the tomb. He had risen like He said He would. 

I believe the three greatest events in history.

**The incarnation** - Jesus was God in flesh.
**The crucification** - Jesus died in subsitution for us. He paid His own body for our sins. So we can be freed from sin's penalty. 
**The ressurection** - The basis of the Christian fatih. 
How do we know Jesus rose from the dead. 
 - Jesus told us He would rise. 
 - The tomb was empty. Jesus physically raised from the dead. It wasn't just spiritual. His body physically raised. 
 - Jesus was seen alive for 40 days and 40 nights. 
 - The conversion of Saul and many others
 - The lives Jesus is changing today. We all have our testimony how Jesus has changed us. We all have become new creations in Christ. 

Come see in verse 6

Come see where the Lord lay. 

1) **We can have His pardon**. If christ hasn't risen we are not free from our sins. 1 Corinthians 15:17
2) **We have His power**. Ephesians 1:19-20
3) **We have His purpsose**. God give us a purpose. 1 Corinthians 15:19 Life is vanity without God. Our soul is restless without God. 
4) **We have His presence**. Hebrews 13:5
5) **We have His pattern** 1 Corinthians 15:20
6) **We have his promise** - John 14 Jesus will come again for us. 

Go tell in verse 7

The angels told us Mary to tell the apostles the good news.
This is just how we should tell others. 

We can't hope in the government. We can't hope in our good works. We can only hope in Jesus. 

Ephesians 2:8

Your brother in Christ,
<br /> Craig

Amen!
