Paul is addressing all the believers who are anxious.
Anxiety is a feeling of worry. You are at unease. 

In this time of panademic everyone is worrying will they have a job. Will they be able to provide food for their family. 

God has a recipe for dealing with anxiety.

##God's presence
Stand fast in the Lord.
Be of the same mind. 
Rejoice in the Lord.

When God's presence is alive in our heart we have joy. It also helps us to be of the same mind. He will help you love others, forgive them and get along with them.

Don't blast through your day see God in every situation. 


## God's peace (Verse 7)

The key to God's peace is coming to God in prayer. 
DL Moody a little peace quote.

His peace guards and protects our hearts and minds.
He protects our emotions and our thoughts. 

John 14:27

### How does the peace come to us?

 - We need to pray correctly - we are to pray about everything. Not just big things but small things as well. 
   - There is 4 ways to pray. We need to pray with adoration, appreciation, supplication and pertition.

1 Peter 5

## We have God's power (Verse 13)

When we are in Christ we have the power of the Holy Spirit helping us. So we can do all things. Not just some things but all things through Jesus Christ. He is our helper. He enables us. He gives us strength.
When you have God's power you can be content with any situation in life. 

What is the context? This is in regards to what God has asked you to do. Don't get confused here Paul is not saying you can jump from one building to another. You can succeed in ministry. You can overcome spiritual warfare. 

## We have God's provision (Verse 19)

God has promised to provide for us. So we can rest in that promise. 
DL Moody called verse 19. God's blank check. 

LOOKUP DL MOODY QUOTE

Why should we not worry?

We have Gods prescence, peace, power and His provision.

John 15:5


<blockquote>

Jesus I know I am a sinner and there is only one way to be forgiven for my sins. It is to put my faith and trust in you. I believe you were born of the virgin Mary and lived a sinless life. That you took my place and died on the cross for my sin. I belive that you ressurected from the dead three days later and that you are exhalted and seated at the right hand of the Father. I want to turn away from my sin and follow you. Please come into my heart and be my Lord. In Jesus Holy name I pray.

Amen!
