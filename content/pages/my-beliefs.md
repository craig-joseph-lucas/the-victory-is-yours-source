## God

I believe in one true God, existing in three persons. The Father, The Son, and the Holy
Spirit. God is the creator of heaven and earth. Thus He is the almighty Father in both
heaven and earth. He is Omniscient. He is Holy. He is Just and righteous. He is truth.
He is freedom. He is omnipresent. He is eternal. He is immuatable. He is full of mercy
and grace. He is love and He is sovereign in all He does. 

## Word of God

I believe the Bible is the inspired word by God. The Bible is God breathed and it is living
(Timothy 3:16). I also believe the Bible is fully true and error free and it is a basis for us
on how to live. It's also one our main weapons in fighting the enemy. It is also also
known as the sword of the spirit. It is the most essential part of the armor of God. Finally
I believe the theme of the bible is God's redemption of man.

## Jesus Christ
I believe that Jesus Christ is God and that he pre-existed as God in all glory in the
creation of Heaven and earth. I believe in the virgin birth and that Jesus entered the World through the womb of
the Virgin Mary. 

I believe that is when the Word became flesh (John 1:14). Jesus lived a
pure sinless live. I believe that he voluntarily died on the cross for our sins. Meaning, he
took the place of us so we can be saved from the penalty of sin (Romans 6:23). Instead
of us dying, He died for us. I believe that he conquered death and sin (Romans 6:8-10)
by rising from the dead three days later. Jesus then went to heaven where He is exalted
and seated at the right hand of the Father. 

Finally I believe He will come back to earth in the second coming
where He will reign and have judgment on the living and the dead. Jesus paid the
ultimate sacrifice for us. A debt he didn't have to pay. A debt we can never pay back.
This is why I am so thankful for what He did for us. Without His sacrifice we cannot be
set free from sin. Without his sacrifice there is no chance for salvation or to be filled with
the Holy Spirit.

## Holy Spirit

As for the Holy Spirit, I believe that the Holy Spirit is the third person in the Godhead.
The Holy Spirit dwells inside every Christian (1 Corinthians 3:16). I believe the job of the
Holy Spirit is to convict us from sin. He regenerates us, works to sanctify us and baptize
us in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. I believe the Holy Spirit loves to comfort us and He is the Spirit of truth. 

It is through the Holy Spirit that we
receive gifts (1 Corinthians 12). It is through the Holy Spirit that we bear fruit. Finally I
believe without the Holy Spirit you can't bear any fruit. 

## Sin

As far as man I believe that man was created in the image of God. That man became
separated from God when Adam and Eve sinned in the garden.(Genesis 3) As a result
we are all born as sinners and are in need of a savior. A one and only true savior in the
name of Jesus Christ that gives us the gift of salvation.

## Salvation

I strongly believe in the gift of salvation and that it is not something someone can earn
or boast about. It is a gift given to us by the amazing grace of Jesus Christ (Ephesians
2:8). To receive this free gift you must have faith and believe in Jesus Christ. You must
believe that he died on the cross for your sins. That he rose from the dead and that your
in need of a savior who can set you free the penalty of your sins. 

Once you accept Jesus
as Lord and repent of your sins you are born again and have eternal life in Jesus Christ
(John 3:16). You become a new creation in Christ. (2 Corinthians 5:17) How great is
that?

## The Church

As far as the church. I believe the church is composed of all true believers, both living
and dead, who have been indwelt and sealed by the Holy Spirit through faith in Jesus
Christ. I believe that everyone should be part of a church and that everyone should be
active members in their church helping to serve the church and have it grow. One can't
grow spiritually if they are not part of an active church.

## End Times

Finally, I believe in Heaven and the rapture. I believe that the rapture will happen pre
tribulation. and that Christ will come and reign on earth for 1,000 years (The Millennium
Kingdom). Finally I believe that everyone who trusted in Christ as their savior will enjoy
eternal glory with Him forever in heaven. While, anyone that rejected him will forever be
separated from His presence.
