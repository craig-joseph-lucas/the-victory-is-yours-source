Hello guest and welcome to our site. 
Our mission is simple. To spread the good news about Jesus Christ. 
It is our role as Christians and children of God. 

<blockquote>
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. - Matthew 28:19-20
</blockquote>

I have put together this site as an outlet. To share my learnings, to tell others about Jesus, and encourage and edify my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. 

God is good all the time and I want to point the glory to Him in whatever opportunities I can. The bible tells us we should praise Jesus all the time(Psalm 113:3). 

Finally, to grow as a christian one of the most important things you can do is not only meditate on God's word but put it into practice. Application is key! This is why the main goal of this site is to show you that you can have victory over anything in life with the help of Jesus Christ.
